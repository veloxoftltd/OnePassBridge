# List of Verifiable Credentials to be issued

The following sections describe the list of credentials which will be issued in the first implementation phase and those proposed for the 2nd implementation phase.

## Phase 1 Credentials

During the first implementation phase of the project, the credentials will be focused on verifying the legal existence of the entity, either the holder (startup) or the verifier (the investor). The verifiable credential will be a combination of both the KYB attributes to verify the legal existence of the company and the KYC type attributes which will verify the identity of the founders and legal representatives of the company.

The attributes decided on in the table below were based on a study of the basic legal existence attributes checked by FundingBox through their legal check of beneficiaries of funding programmes and startups within the Investment fund and from the checks done by BIA (Bulgarian Industrial Association).

These attributes will be converted to a EBSI compatible data schema.
